# Car Sales Dashboard  

This project involves building a **data visualization dashboard** using **Power BI**, **Power Query**, **MS Excel**, and **Advanced DAX** techniques. 
The dashboard provides key insights into car sales data, focusing on year-to-date (YTD) and month-to-date (MTD) sales performance, regional trends, and company-level analysis.

## Project Overview  

The **Car Sales Dashboard** is an interactive tool designed to analyze and present sales data effectively. It allows stakeholders to track metrics such as total sales, cars sold, year-over-year (YOY) growth, and average prices. The dashboard also highlights regional sales performance and body style/color preferences.

### Key Metrics Visualized:  
- **YTD Total Sales**: Overall revenue generated year-to-date.  
- **MTD Total Sales**: Revenue generated in the current month.  
- **YOY Growth**: Year-over-year percentage growth in cars sold.  
- **Cars Sold**: Total vehicles sold for YTD and MTD.  
- **Regional and Weekly Trends**: Sales patterns across different regions and time periods.  
- **Company-Wise Trends**: Performance comparison across car brands.

## Features  

1. **Interactive Visualizations**:
   - **Cards**: Summarize KPIs like total sales, YOY growth, and average prices.  
   - **Line Chart**: Weekly trends of sales prices.  
   - **Pie Charts**: Represent total sales by car color and body style.  
   - **Map**: Geographical distribution of sales by dealer region.  
   - **Table**: Compare company-wise performance, including average prices and growth.

2. **Data Interactivity**:
   - Filters and slicers for dynamic exploration of data.  
   - Drill-through features for detailed insights.

3. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Leverages **Advanced DAX** for custom calculations.  
   - Tracks YTD/MTD growth and sales differences across periods.

## Tools & Technologies Used  

- **Power BI**: For data modeling, visualization, and interactivity.  
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning, transformation, and integration.  
- **MS Excel**: For initial data preparation and exploratory analysis.  
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For creating advanced metrics and KPIs.

## Workflow Steps  

### 1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Imported raw car sales data into **MS Excel** for initial exploration and structuring.  
   - Utilized **Power Query** to:
     - Remove duplicates and irrelevant fields.  
     - Handle missing values (e.g., replacing nulls or dropping rows).  
     - Clean column names and ensure consistent data formats.  
     - Aggregate data for summarization (e.g., grouping by date, region, and color).  

### 2. **Data Modeling**  
   - Defined relationships between datasets (e.g., linking sales with regions, car models, and categories).  
   - Created **calculated columns** for metrics such as total sales, growth rates, and price averages.  

### 3. **Dashboard Creation in Power BI**  
   - Imported cleaned and modeled data into Power BI.  
   - Designed visuals to include:
     - **Cards** for KPIs like YTD Sales, MTD Sales, YOY Growth, and Cars Sold.  
     - **Line Chart** to track weekly sales trends.  
     - **Map Visualization** to analyze regional performance.  
     - **Pie Charts** to display sales distribution by car color and body style.  
     - **Tables** to compare company-level performance metrics.
   - Incorporated slicers for filtering by time periods, regions, and categories.  

### 4. **Advanced DAX Implementation**  
   - Created measures using **DAX** for:
     - YTD and MTD cumulative sales.  
     - YOY growth percentages and period comparisons.  
     - Average prices, cars sold differences, and other KPIs.  
   - Enhanced calculations with advanced DAX functions such as **CALCULATE**, **DATEADD**, **SUMX**, and **ALLSELECTED**.

### 5. **Dashboard Optimization**  
   - Applied a professional dark theme for aesthetics and clarity.  
   - Formatted labels, tooltips, and legends for better readability.  
   - Optimized visuals for responsive interaction.  

### 6. **Publishing and Sharing**  
   - Published the dashboard using **Power BI Service** for sharing and collaboration.  
   - Exported the Power BI report as a **.pbix file** for offline access.
